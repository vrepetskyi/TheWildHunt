# The Wild Hunt

## Features

- ~~unique name~~

### Simulation

- use of design patterns:
  - Builder for stricter Simulation creation (potential for different maps, animal presets and editor)
  - Observer for UI updates
  - Prototype for Animal instantiation from a phenotype and Prey reproduction
- needs of an Animal are extendible
- use of access modifiers
- functionality reuse via abstract classes
- intermediary classes for shorter method parameters

### UI

- UI and Simulation are independent (potential for theming)
- virtual camera (map zooming and panning)
- list view and controller are reused
- real time refresh
- tile coordinates indicator
- simulation timer
- styling
